# Development Process Documentation

## Project Overview

Building an AI Interview Dashboard for DaCodes (Key Singularity) technical assessment. This is a 6-8 hour project to demonstrate proficiency with AI-assisted development using Claude Code.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Table/Query, Recharts, Biome

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Setup & Architecture (3 hours)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What I Did:**
- Analyzed requirements with Claude Code assistance
- Defined tech stack based on my ShortCat production experience
- Created comprehensive documentation structure
- Set up Task Master AI workflow (differentiator)
- Generated 12 main tasks from PRD
- Ran complexity analysis on all tasks
- Expanded 9 high-complexity tasks (score ‚â• 5) into 58 subtasks

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose Biome over ESLint (cleaner, used in previous role)
- Selected Recharts over TanStack Charts (better Claude support)
- Using Context API instead of Zustand (simpler for this scope)
- Implementing strict approval workflow before code saves
- Strategic AI usage: Opus for planning & complex tasks, Sonnet for straightforward execution

**Time Breakdown:**
- Requirements analysis: 30 min
- Documentation architecture: 1.5 hours
- Workflow setup: 30 min
- Task Master setup & expansion: 30 min

### Phase 2: Implementation
**Status:** üîÑ Ready to Start

**Approach:**
With comprehensive planning complete (12 main tasks, 58 subtasks), now proceeding with systematic implementation:
- Task #1: GitHub repository creation and project initialization
- Task #2-12: Feature implementation following task breakdown
- Each task includes built-in quality gates and documentation updates
- Following strict approval workflow before code saves

**Note on Original Requirements:**
The original feature requirements document estimated 7-10 hours for feature implementation, with no planning time allocated. The upfront investment in comprehensive task breakdown creates a clear execution roadmap.

## Claude Code Usage Summary

### Effectiveness Metrics
- **Setup Phase Productivity:** 4x faster with Claude
- **Documentation Quality:** Higher with AI assistance
- **Iterations Required:** 2-3 per major component
- **Success Rate:** 70% first attempt, 100% after feedback

### Where AI Was Most Helpful
1. **Documentation Structure** - Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md efficiently
2. **Requirements Analysis** - Processed multiple documents simultaneously
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Adapted ShortCat patterns successfully
4. **Workflow Development** - Built production-quality process

### Where Manual Work Was Needed
1. **Requirements Alignment** - Ensuring exact folder structure match
2. **Brand Details** - Adding specific fonts and colors
3. **Approval Flow** - Correcting workflow sequence
4. **PRD Balance** - Finding right level of detail

## Technical Decisions

### Pre-Planning: Company Research & Analysis

Before selecting the tech stack, I:
- **Analyzed KeySingularity's website and AI interview product** to understand their brand identity and technical context
- **Reviewed the original requirements** which estimated 7-10 hours for features (without planning time allocated)
- **Identified brand elements:** #facc15 (yellow), #0D121C (dark), IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans fonts
- **Recognized data-heavy dashboard needs:** Complex tables, charts, filtering - perfect for TanStack ecosystem

This research informed all subsequent technical decisions.

### Tech Stack Rationale

**Next.js 14 over Vite:**
- Routing included out of the box (saves 1-2 hours of configuration)
- One-click Vercel deployment (critical for live demo)
- SSR/SSG capabilities if needed
- Familiar ecosystem from production experience

**TypeScript (strict mode):**
- Explicitly required in assignment
- My core specialty
- Enables type-safe development end-to-end

**shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS:**
- Pre-built accessible components (Table, Dialog, Form, etc.)
- Saves 3-4 hours vs. building from scratch
- Professional look automatic
- Already mastered in ShortCat project
- Easy to customize with KeySingularity brand colors

**Recharts over TanStack Charts:**
- Mature library (since 2016) with excellent Claude Code support
- TanStack Charts too recent - Claude unfamiliar with it
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Production-proven in similar dashboards

**TanStack Table v8:**
- Mentioned in requirements document
- Perfect for complex filtering/sorting/pagination
- Headless design integrates seamlessly with shadcn
- Industry standard for data-heavy interfaces

**TanStack Query:**
- Automatic caching and data fetching optimization
- Successfully used in ShortCat production project
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reduces boilerplate significantly

**Context API over Zustand:**
- Project needs are simple: filters state, form state, mock session
- Don't add complexity where it's not needed
- Claude Code handles Context patterns perfectly
- Easier to understand for code review

**React Hook Form + Zod:**
- Proven stack from ShortCat
- Type-safe validation end-to-end
- Centralized schemas in `/lib/schemas`
- Claude Code generates excellent form code

**Biome over ESLint:**
- Used successfully in previous role
- Faster and simpler configuration
- Modern alternative with better DX

**Vitest + React Testing Library:**
- My testing stack from ShortCat
- Selective coverage (60-70%) on critical logic
- Focus on business logic, not UI snapshots
- Claude Code generates good test boilerplate

### Architecture Choices
- **Monorepo Structure:** No - Simple `api/` and `frontend/` folders per requirements
- **State Management:** Context API - Sufficient for interview dashboard scope
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query - Better caching and state management
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form + Zod - Type-safe validation
- **Testing:** Vitest with selective coverage - Focus on critical paths only

### Trade-offs Made
- **Speed vs Perfection:** Prioritizing functional features over polish
- **Documentation vs Code:** 30% grade on docs, so heavy documentation focus
- **Custom vs Library:** Using shadcn/ui to save component development time
- **Testing Coverage:** 60% on critical paths vs 100% coverage

### What I'd Do Differently (If More Time)
- Add E2E tests with Playwright
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add performance optimizations (virtualization)
- Create custom design system
- Add more animations/transitions

## Development Process

### Workflow Innovation
Using Task Master AI from my ShortCat experience - this is my key differentiator:
- Automated task tracking
- Enforced documentation updates
- Quality gates at each step
- Clear approval workflow

### Git Strategy
- Conventional commits showing progression
- Minimum 5 meaningful commits
- Commit after each completed feature
- Clear history of development process

### Documentation Strategy
- **CLAUDE_CODE.md:** Detailed AI interactions (updated continuously)
- **DEVELOPMENT.md:** High-level summary (updated before commits)
- **README.md:** Setup instructions (final)

## Lessons Learned

### Prompt Engineering
- Provide complete context upfront
- Be explicit about constraints
- Use production examples as reference
- Iterate with specific feedback

### AI Collaboration
- Claude excels at scaffolding
- Needs guidance on specific requirements
- Quick to correct with clear feedback
- Documentation generation is excellent

### Time Management
- Setup phase critical for success
- Don't over-engineer early features
- Leave time for documentation
- Test as you go, not at the end

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Requirements analysis
- ‚úÖ Tech stack definition
- ‚úÖ Documentation structure
- ‚úÖ Workflow setup
- ‚úÖ PRD creation
- ‚úÖ Task Master setup (12 tasks + 58 subtasks)
- ‚úÖ Complexity analysis and task expansion

**Next Steps:**
- üîÑ First commit: Documentation and Task Master setup
- ‚è≥ Task #1: Create GitHub repository and initialize project
- ‚è≥ Task #2: Set up design system
- ‚è≥ Task #3: Implement data layer
- ‚è≥ Continue through remaining tasks...

**Blockers:** None

**Risk:** Time constraint (6-8 hours) - mitigating by using production patterns and heavy Claude assistance
