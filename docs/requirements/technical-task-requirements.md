# AI INTERVIEW DASHBOARD - TECHNICAL ASSIGNMENT
## Build Admin Dashboard for Voice AI Interviewing Platform

**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours
**Due:** Submit within 72 hours of receipt

---

## üéØ THE SCENARIO

You're joining a team that has built a **voice-enabled AI interviewing agent**. The AI conducts interviews, but we need dashboards for clients to:
- Track completed interviews
- View reports and candidate dispositions
- Create new interview flows
- Manage candidates

The backend APIs are ready, but the admin dashboard is missing. Your job is to build it.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: THIS IS A CLAUDE CODE TEST

**We are specifically testing your ability to work WITH AI coding assistants.**

This assignment evaluates:
- ‚úÖ **How effectively you use Claude Code** (or similar AI tools)
- ‚úÖ **Your prompting skills** - Can you get Claude to help you efficiently?
- ‚úÖ **Your AI collaboration workflow** - How do you partner with AI?
- ‚úÖ **Your code review skills** - Can you catch AI mistakes?
- ‚úÖ **Your documentation** - Can you explain what Claude helped with?

**WE EXPECT AND ENCOURAGE HEAVY CLAUDE CODE USAGE!**

This is NOT about coding without AI. This is about:
- Using Claude Code to scaffold components
- Using Claude Code to debug issues
- Using Claude Code to write tests
- Using Claude Code to understand APIs
- **Documenting everything Claude helped you with**

**The CLAUDE_CODE.md documentation is just as important as your actual code.**

## üìã WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING

### Dashboard Features Required

**1. Interview Tracking Dashboard**
- List of all completed interviews
- Filter by: date range, job position, status, candidate
- Search by candidate name or email
- Sort by: completion date, score, status
- Visual metrics: total interviews, completion rate, average score
- Export to CSV

**2. Interview Report View**
- Detailed interview transcript/summary
- AI-generated candidate assessment
- Scoring breakdown by competency
- Recommendations (hire/no-hire/maybe)
- Audio playback controls (simulated)
- Interviewer notes section

**3. Candidate Management**
- List all candidates
- View candidate profile with interview history
- Add new candidates manually
- Bulk upload candidates (CSV)
- Candidate disposition workflow (pending ‚Üí interviewed ‚Üí hired/rejected)
- Email invitation system (simulated)

**4. Interview Flow Builder**
- Create new interview templates
- Define questions for each job role
- Set evaluation criteria/competencies
- Configure interview duration and structure
- Duplicate existing templates
- Preview interview flow

**5. Client Analytics Dashboard**
- Interview completion funnel (invited ‚Üí started ‚Üí completed)
- Time-to-completion metrics
- Top performing candidates
- Hiring pipeline status
- Interview quality scores
- Charts/graphs for key metrics

---

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Frontend
**Stack:** Your choice, but must use:
- **React/Vue/Svelte** + TypeScript
- **Chart library** for analytics (Chart.js, Recharts, D3, etc.)
- **Table library** for data grids (TanStack Table, AG-Grid, or custom)
- **Routing** (React Router, Vue Router, etc.)
- **State management** (Context, Redux, Zustand, Pinia, etc.)

**UI/UX:**
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Empty states when no data
- Professional, clean design (Tailwind/Material-UI/shadcn acceptable)

### Backend/API (Provided)
You'll work with a **simulated REST API** (see starter code below).
In a real scenario, you'd integrate with our actual API.

**Key Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/interviews                    # List all interviews
GET    /api/interviews/:id                # Get interview details
POST   /api/interviews                    # Create new interview
GET    /api/candidates                    # List candidates
GET    /api/candidates/:id                # Get candidate details
POST   /api/candidates                    # Add candidate
PATCH  /api/candidates/:id                # Update candidate
POST   /api/candidates/bulk               # Bulk upload
GET    /api/interview-templates           # List templates
POST   /api/interview-templates           # Create template
GET    /api/analytics                     # Get analytics data
```

### Data Management
- Handle loading states properly
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Cache data to reduce API calls
- Handle errors gracefully

**Prompt:** "Help me set up a React TypeScript project with these routes..."
**Result:** Claude generated package.json and routing structure
**My modifications:** Had to adjust TypeScript config for strict mode

## Interview List Component
**Prompt:** "Create a filterable table component..."
**Claude's code:** [paste relevant snippet]
**Issues found:** Filter wasn't debounced, caused too many re-renders
**My fix:** Added useDeferredValue hook

[More examples...]
```

**What we want to see:**
‚úÖ Actual prompts you used (copy-paste them!)
‚úÖ Claude's responses (show the code it generated)
‚úÖ Your modifications and why
‚úÖ Honest reflection on what worked/didn't work
‚úÖ Evidence of iteration and learning

**What NOT to do:**
‚ùå "I used Claude for components" (too vague)
‚ùå "Claude helped a lot" (no specifics)
‚ùå Claiming you did everything yourself (defeats the purpose)

## üí° TIPS FOR SUCCESS

**1. Document Your Claude Code Usage AS YOU GO** ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT
- Keep CLAUDE_CODE.md open and add notes after each Claude interaction
- Copy-paste prompts you used and Claude's responses
- Note what worked and what didn't
- This documentation is 30% of your grade - don't save it for the end!

**2. Use Claude Code Aggressively:**
- **Start here:** "Claude, help me set up a React TypeScript project with routing for these 5 pages..."
- **For components:** "Create a filterable table component for interviews with these fields..."
- **For debugging:** "This filter isn't working, here's my code: [paste code]"
- **For tests:** "Write tests for this InterviewList component"
- **For charts:** "Help me create a radar chart showing competency scores using Recharts"
- Don't be shy - use Claude for everything, just document it!

**3. Iterate With Claude:**
- If Claude's first attempt doesn't work, refine your prompt
- Ask Claude to explain code it generated
- Ask Claude to review your code
- Show Claude error messages and ask for help
- Document this iteration process!

**4. Show Your Thinking:**
- When Claude generates buggy code, document how you fixed it
- When Claude's approach was wrong, explain what you did instead
- Show where you had to override or correct Claude
- This demonstrates you're not just copy-pasting blindly

**5. Time Management:**
- Hour 1-2: Core dashboard (use Claude heavily!)
- Hour 3-4: Charts and analytics (Claude is great at this)
- Hour 5-6: Candidate management
- Hour 7: Template builder
- Hour 8: Polish, testing, and DOCUMENT your Claude usage

**6. What We Want to See:**
- ‚úÖ Heavy Claude Code usage with detailed documentation
- ‚úÖ Evidence you can review/debug AI code
- ‚úÖ Iterative refinement of prompts
- ‚úÖ Honest about what Claude helped with
- ‚ùå Perfect code with no AI documentation
- ‚ùå Claiming you did everything yourself
