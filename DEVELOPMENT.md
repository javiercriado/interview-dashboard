## Project Overview

Building an AI Interview Dashboard for DaCodes (Key Singularity) technical assessment. This is a 6-8 hour project to demonstrate proficiency with AI-assisted development using Claude Code.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Table/Query, Recharts, Biome

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Setup & Architecture (3 hours)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What I Did:**
- Analyzed requirements with Claude Code assistance
- Defined tech stack based on my ShortCat production experience
- Created comprehensive documentation structure
- Set up Task Master AI workflow (differentiator)
- Generated 12 main tasks from PRD
- Ran complexity analysis on all tasks
- Expanded 9 high-complexity tasks (score ‚â• 5) into 58 subtasks

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose Biome over ESLint (cleaner, used in previous role)
- Selected Recharts over TanStack Charts (better Claude support)
- Using Context API instead of Zustand (simpler for this scope)
- Implementing strict approval workflow before code saves
- Strategic AI usage: Opus for planning & complex tasks, Sonnet for straightforward execution

**Time Breakdown:**
- Requirements analysis: 30 min
- Documentation architecture: 1.5 hours
- Workflow setup: 30 min
- Task Master setup & expansion: 30 min

### Phase 2: Implementation
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress

**Approach:**
With comprehensive planning complete (12 main tasks, 58 subtasks), now proceeding with systematic implementation:
- ‚úÖ Task #1: Project initialization and foundation setup
- ‚è≥ Task #2-12: Feature implementation following task breakdown
- Each task includes built-in quality gates and documentation updates
- Following strict approval workflow before code saves

**Note on Original Requirements:**
The original feature requirements document estimated 7-10 hours for feature implementation, with no planning time allocated. The upfront investment in comprehensive task breakdown creates a clear execution roadmap.

### Task #1: Project Initialization (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Time:** ~60 minutes
**Claude Effectiveness:** 9/10

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Created Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and App Router
- Set up Tailwind CSS with KeySingularity branding (#facc15 yellow, #0D121C dark)
- Configured Biome linting (not ESLint) with recommended rules
- Built mock Express API server with 8 endpoints (interviews, candidates, templates, analytics)
- Implemented IBM Plex Mono (headings) and Open Sans (body) fonts
- Added concurrently scripts for running both servers
- Created two-file documentation system (CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md + CLAUDE_CODE.md)
- Updated WORKFLOW.md with dependency check strategy

**Key Claude Interactions:**
1. **Initial Setup** - Generated complete project structure and configs (saved ~30 min)
2. **Biome Linting** - Auto-fixed 3,221 formatting errors (saved ~15 min)
3. **CSS Build Error** - Diagnosed missing Tailwind color classes in config (saved ~5 min)

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚ùå **Build Failure:** CSS used `text-foreground` class that didn't exist
  - **Fix:** Extended Tailwind config with foreground, border, muted colors
  - **Learning:** Production build stricter than dev server - always test builds early

- ‚ùå **Context Limit:** Hit 4% during setup phase
  - **Fix:** Created detailed handoff prompt for session continuity
  - **Learning:** Better session planning needed for long tasks

**Documentation Strategy Established:**
- `CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md` - Chronological log of ALL interactions (append as we go)
- `CLAUDE_CODE.md` - 8 required sections organized for submission (updated before commits)
- Only document significant interactions (Claude asks first)
- Update summary file before each commit

**Dependency Strategy:**
- Install dependencies as needed per feature (not all upfront)
- Reference PRD.md lines 14-23 for required tech stack
- Document each installation with justification

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~45 minutes (43% faster than manual)

### Task #3: Data Layer and State Management Setup (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Time:** ~25 minutes
**Claude Effectiveness:** 10/10

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Designed type safety architecture adapted from ShortCat monorepo patterns
- Created complete API type definitions (Interview, Candidate, Template, Analytics)
- Built Zod validation schemas for form inputs only (not API responses)
- Implemented typed API client with all 8 endpoints
- Set up TanStack Query with optimized caching strategy (5min staleTime, 10min gcTime)
- Created custom hooks for all endpoints with proper cache invalidation
- Built global app context for UI state (sidebar, theme)
- Integrated QueryProvider and AppProvider into root layout
- Added comprehensive type safety documentation to CLAUDE.md

**Key Claude Interactions:**
1. **Architecture Discussion** - Strategic analysis of type safety patterns (saved ~15 min)
   - Decision: Simple frontend-only pattern (no shared folder)
   - Zod for forms only, TypeScript for API responses
   - Reference docs from Shortcat analyzed for best practices

2. **Code Generation** - Created 12 files with ~550 lines of code (saved ~60 min)
   - types.ts (74 lines)
   - schemas.ts (72 lines) - NEW architecture decision
   - api.ts (121 lines)
   - 4 custom hook files (111 lines total)
   - Provider and context files (57 lines total)

3. **TypeScript Error Fix** - Caught and fixed type incompatibility (saved ~5 min)
   - User found: `CandidateFilters` not assignable to `Record<string, string | undefined>`
   - Claude fixed: Changed to `Record<string, unknown>` with runtime type guard

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety Error:** buildQueryString parameter type too restrictive
  - **Fix:** Used Record<string, unknown> with typeof guard for runtime safety
  - **Outcome:** Zero TypeScript errors, all type checks passing

**Quality Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Lint: 9 files auto-fixed (import ordering, formatting)
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passed with 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Build: Compiled successfully (87.2 kB bundle size)
- ‚úÖ Dev server: Running successfully on localhost:3002

**Dependencies Installed:**
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
```

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Single source of truth:** types.ts for all API data structures
- **Zod for validation:** Forms, CSV uploads, user input only
- **No runtime validation:** Trust our own API responses (performance)
- **Proper caching:** TanStack Query with strategic cache invalidation
- **Type-safe hooks:** All endpoints have typed React Query hooks

**Documentation Added:**
- Complete type safety section in CLAUDE.md (~200 lines)
- Philosophy: Zod for forms, TypeScript for API
- Patterns and anti-patterns
- Adding new types workflow

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~60 minutes (71% faster than manual implementation)

**Strategic Decision:**
Adapted Shortcat's comprehensive monorepo type safety patterns to a simpler single-app architecture. This demonstrates critical thinking about when to scale down complex patterns for appropriate project scope.

## Technical Decisions

### Pre-Planning: Company Research & Analysis

Before selecting the tech stack, I:
- **Analyzed KeySingularity's website and AI interview product** to understand their brand identity and technical context
- **Reviewed the original requirements** which estimated 7-10 hours for features (without planning time allocated)
- **Identified brand elements:** #facc15 (yellow), #0D121C (dark), IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans fonts
- **Recognized data-heavy dashboard needs:** Complex tables, charts, filtering - perfect for TanStack ecosystem

This research informed all subsequent technical decisions.

### Tech Stack Rationale

**Next.js 14 over Vite:**
- Routing included out of the box (saves 1-2 hours of configuration)
- One-click Vercel deployment (critical for live demo)
- SSR/SSG capabilities if needed
- Familiar ecosystem from production experience

**TypeScript (strict mode):**
- Explicitly required in assignment
- My core specialty
- Enables type-safe development end-to-end

**shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS:**
- Pre-built accessible components (Table, Dialog, Form, etc.)
- Saves 3-4 hours vs. building from scratch
- Professional look automatic
- Already mastered in ShortCat project
- Easy to customize with KeySingularity brand colors

**Recharts over TanStack Charts:**
- Mature library (since 2016) with excellent Claude Code support
- TanStack Charts too recent - Claude unfamiliar with it
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Production-proven in similar dashboards

**TanStack Table v8:**
- Mentioned in requirements document
- Perfect for complex filtering/sorting/pagination
- Headless design integrates seamlessly with shadcn
- Industry standard for data-heavy interfaces

**TanStack Query:**
- Automatic caching and data fetching optimization
- Successfully used in ShortCat production project
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reduces boilerplate significantly

**Context API over Zustand:**
- Project needs are simple: filters state, form state, mock session
- Don't add complexity where it's not needed
- Claude Code handles Context patterns perfectly
- Easier to understand for code review

**React Hook Form + Zod:**
- Proven stack from ShortCat
- Type-safe validation end-to-end
- Centralized schemas in `/lib/schemas`
- Claude Code generates excellent form code

**Biome over ESLint:**
- Used successfully in previous role
- Faster and simpler configuration
- Modern alternative with better DX

**Vitest + React Testing Library:**
- My testing stack from ShortCat
- Selective coverage (60-70%) on critical logic
- Focus on business logic, not UI snapshots
- Claude Code generates good test boilerplate

### Architecture Choices
- **Monorepo Structure:** No - Simple `api/` and `frontend/` folders per requirements
- **State Management:** Context API - Sufficient for interview dashboard scope
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query - Better caching and state management
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form + Zod - Type-safe validation
- **Testing:** Vitest with selective coverage - Focus on critical paths only

### Trade-offs Made
- **Speed vs Perfection:** Prioritizing functional features over polish
- **Documentation vs Code:** 30% grade on docs, so heavy documentation focus
- **Custom vs Library:** Using shadcn/ui to save component development time
- **Testing Coverage:** 60% on critical paths vs 100% coverage

### What I'd Do Differently (If More Time)
- Add E2E tests with Playwright
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add performance optimizations (virtualization)
- Create custom design system
- Add more animations/transitions

## Development Process

3. **Lint Issues** - Fixed array index keys and pre-existing skeleton issues from Task #4 (saved ~10 min)

**Critical Issues & Corrections:**
- ‚ùå **Type Safety Pattern:** Used `typeof interview.status` instead of proper type import
  - **User Feedback:** "Import Interview type and use `Interview['status']`. Check CLAUDE.md type safety patterns"
  - **Fix:** Added `import type { Interview } from '@/lib/types'` and changed to `Record<Interview['status'], string>`
  - **Learning:** Always import and use defined types with bracket notation for union subsets

- ‚ùå **Array Index Keys:** Used `index` as key in transcript paragraph map
  - **Lint Error:** "Avoid using the index of an array as key property"
  - **Fix:** Changed to content-based key: `${paragraph.substring(0, 50)}-${paragraph.length}`
  - **Learning:** Use content-based unique identifiers for React keys

- ‚úÖ **Bonus Fix:** Cleaned up pre-existing skeleton key issues from Task #4
  - **Issue:** interview-list.tsx had 2 lint warnings about skeleton array index keys
  - **Fix:** Generate keys in Array.from initialization: `Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `skeleton-row-${i}`)`
  - **Impact:** Achieved completely clean lint with 0 errors

**Documentation Updates:**
- Added Task #5 entry to CLAUDE_CODE.md Component Development section
- Updated WORKFLOW.md Step 2 with type safety reminder:
  ```markdown
  - **Type Safety**: ALWAYS import and use types from `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`
    - Use `Interview['status']` instead of `typeof interview.status`
    - Reference `interview-list.tsx` for examples
  ```

**Quality Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Lint: Passed (0 errors, including fixing pre-existing issues)
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passed with 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Build: Compiled successfully

**localStorage Implementation:**
- Notes saved to `interview-notes-{interviewId}` key
- Auto-save on every keystroke (onChange)
- Loads saved notes on component mount
- Persists across page refreshes

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~50 minutes (59% faster including corrections)

**Key Takeaways:**
- Type safety patterns are critical - using `Type['field']` for union subsets
- Content-based keys better than array indices for dynamic lists
- Running full quality checks catches both new and pre-existing issues
- Recharts integrates seamlessly with Tailwind/shadcn design system
- localStorage persistence adds polish with minimal code

- Recharts `data.payload` provides access to original data in tooltips
- YAxis `width` prop controls label truncation
- Static skeleton arrays can use biome-ignore for index keys

---

**Next Steps:**
- ‚è≥ Task #7-12: Continue through remaining tasks...

**Blockers:** None

**Risk:** Time constraint (6-8 hours) - mitigating by using production patterns and heavy Claude assistance

---

### Task #7: Candidate Management CRUD Operations (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Time:** ~45 minutes (including iterations)
**Claude Effectiveness:** 9/10

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Created complete candidate management system with all PRD requirements (lines 100-138)
- Built CandidateList component with TanStack Table (6 sortable columns)
- Implemented search with `useDeferredValue` for performance optimization
- Added position and status filter dropdowns
- Created reusable CandidateForm component with React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Built candidate detail view with profile info, interview history, and status workflow
- Implemented 4-step workflow visualization (pending ‚Üí invited ‚Üí interviewed ‚Üí hired/rejected)
- Added edit candidate feature (reuses CandidateForm component)
- Created bulk CSV upload with full drag & drop support
- Implemented CSV parsing, validation, and preview table
- Added simulated email invitation functionality
- Updated home page with navigation cards for all dashboard sections

**Note:** The bulk CSV upload implementation (subtask 7.4) also fulfilled all requirements of Task #8 ("Build CSV Bulk Upload Feature"), which was marked as complete since the functionality was delivered as part of this task.

**Component Files Created (7 files):**
1. `candidate-list.tsx` (292 lines) - Table, filters, search, header actions
2. `candidate-form.tsx` (165 lines) - Form with validation, create/edit reusability
3. `bulk-upload-form.tsx` (281 lines) - Drag & drop upload, CSV parsing, validation preview
4. `candidates/page.tsx` - List page wrapper
5. `candidates/new/page.tsx` - Add candidate page
6. `candidates/[id]/page.tsx` (309 lines) - Detail view with workflow UI
7. `candidates/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit page (reuses CandidateForm)

**Key Claude Interactions:**
1. **Type Safety Learning** - User taught Claude to use `Pick<>` utility type for derived types
   - Issue: Standalone ParsedCandidate interface duplicated Candidate fields
   - Fix: `type ParsedCandidate = Pick<Candidate, ...> & { isValid, errors }`
   - Learning: DRY principle - derive types from existing interfaces

2. **PRD Alignment Review** - User caught 4 missing requirements before marking complete
   - Missing 4th workflow step (hired/rejected)
   - Missing edit candidate feature
   - Wrong column (Applied Date instead of Interview Date)
   - Missing drag & drop implementation
   - All fixed immediately with user guidance

3. **Quality Checks** - Fixed 3 lint/build errors
   - Label without htmlFor ‚Üí changed to div
   - Array index keys ‚Üí combined email + index
   - Lucide icon title attribute ‚Üí wrapped in div

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **Type Derivation:** Used Pick<> for better type safety and DRY principle
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Completeness:** Added 4th step with proper highlighting logic
- ‚úÖ **Component Reuse:** Edit page reuses CandidateForm (zero duplication)
- ‚úÖ **Drag & Drop:** Implemented onDragOver, onDragLeave, onDrop handlers with visual feedback
- ‚úÖ **Build Error:** Fixed Lucide icon title attribute not supported

**Quality Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Lint: Passed (0 errors, 47 files checked)
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passed with 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Build: Successful (9 routes compiled)
- ‚úÖ Dev server: Running without errors

**All 8 Subtasks Completed:**
- 7.1: CandidateList component with TanStack Table ‚úÖ
- 7.2: CandidateForm with React Hook Form + Zod ‚úÖ
- 7.3: Form field validation logic ‚úÖ
- 7.4: CandidateDetail view ‚úÖ
- 7.5: Status workflow UI components (4 steps) ‚úÖ
- 7.6: CRUD API integration (hooks existed) ‚úÖ
- 7.7: Filtering and search functionality ‚úÖ
- 7.8: Simulated email invitation feature ‚úÖ

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~90 minutes (67% faster including user-driven iterations)

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Pick<> utility type** is better than duplicating interface fields
- **Always verify against PRD** before marking task complete
- **Drag & drop requires 3 handlers:** onDragOver, onDragLeave, onDrop
- **Lucide icons don't support title** attribute - wrap in div for tooltips
- **Build catches errors** that dev server misses
- **User review is critical** for catching missing requirements

   - RadarChart wrong scale (0-1 vs 0-100)
   - Accessibility error (keyboard event needed)

**Critical Issues & Fixes:**

**Issue #1: Date Range Filter**
- **Problem:** API had `startDate`/`endDate` parameters but wasn't using them
- **First Fix:** Added filter logic with `setHours()` - didn't include end date properly
- **Second Fix:** Changed to `setUTCHours()` to handle UTC timestamps correctly
- **Learning:** Always use UTC methods when working with UTC dates

**Issue #2: Mobile Sidebar Logo**
- **Problem:** X button overlapping logo on mobile
- **First Attempt:** `px-6 lg:px-6 px-16` (conflicting classes)
- **Fix:** `pl-16 pr-6 lg:px-6` (proper responsive padding)
- **Learning:** Use separate pl-/pr- for asymmetric padding

**Issue #3: RadarChart Scale**
- **Problem:** API returns 0-100 scores, chart configured for 0-1
- **Fix:** Changed `domain={[0, 100]}`, `fullMark: 100`, removed `* 100` in progress bars
- **Learning:** Verify API data format before configuring charts

**Issue #4: Accessibility**
- **Problem:** Overlay had onClick but no keyboard handler
- **Fix:** Added onKeyDown (Escape key), role, tabIndex, aria-label
- **Learning:** Interactive elements need both mouse and keyboard events

**Quality Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Lint: Auto-fixed 6 files, 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passed with 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Build: Compiled successfully (9 static pages, 87.5 kB bundle)
- ‚úÖ User Testing: All features validated

**Files Modified:**
- `api/server.js` (date filtering with UTC)
- `frontend/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` (mobile layout + accessibility)
- `frontend/src/app/interviews/[id]/page.tsx` (radar chart scale)
- `frontend/src/components/interviews/interview-list.tsx` (CSV export + sorting)
- Multiple pages wrapped in AppLayout

**Total Iterations:** 6 (date filter: 2, mobile logo: 2, chart: 1, a11y: 1)

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~60 minutes (46% faster including all corrections)

**Key Takeaways:**
- **User testing catches issues quality checks miss**
- **API server needs restart after changes** (no hot reload)
- **UTC timezone handling critical** for date filtering
- **Responsive layouts need mobile testing**
- **Accessibility linting prevents usability issues**

**Blockers:** None

**Risk:** Time constraint (6-8 hours) - mitigating by using production patterns and heavy Claude assistance
