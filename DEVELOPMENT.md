# Development Process Documentation

## Project Overview

Building an AI Interview Dashboard for DaCodes (Key Singularity) technical assessment. This is a 6-8 hour project to demonstrate proficiency with AI-assisted development using Claude Code.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Table/Query, Recharts, Biome

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Setup & Architecture (3 hours)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What I Did:**
- Analyzed requirements with Claude Code assistance
- Defined tech stack based on my ShortCat production experience
- Created comprehensive documentation structure
- Set up Task Master AI workflow (differentiator)
- Generated 12 main tasks from PRD
- Ran complexity analysis on all tasks
- Expanded 9 high-complexity tasks (score ‚â• 5) into 58 subtasks

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose Biome over ESLint (cleaner, used in previous role)
- Selected Recharts over TanStack Charts (better Claude support)
- Using Context API instead of Zustand (simpler for this scope)
- Implementing strict approval workflow before code saves
- Strategic AI usage: Opus for planning & complex tasks, Sonnet for straightforward execution

**Time Breakdown:**
- Requirements analysis: 30 min
- Documentation architecture: 1.5 hours
- Workflow setup: 30 min
- Task Master setup & expansion: 30 min

### Phase 2: Implementation
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress

**Approach:**
With comprehensive planning complete (12 main tasks, 58 subtasks), now proceeding with systematic implementation:
- ‚úÖ Task #1: Project initialization and foundation setup
- ‚è≥ Task #2-12: Feature implementation following task breakdown
- Each task includes built-in quality gates and documentation updates
- Following strict approval workflow before code saves

**Note on Original Requirements:**
The original feature requirements document estimated 7-10 hours for feature implementation, with no planning time allocated. The upfront investment in comprehensive task breakdown creates a clear execution roadmap.

### Task #1: Project Initialization (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Time:** ~60 minutes
**Claude Effectiveness:** 9/10

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Created Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and App Router
- Set up Tailwind CSS with KeySingularity branding (#facc15 yellow, #0D121C dark)
- Configured Biome linting (not ESLint) with recommended rules
- Built mock Express API server with 8 endpoints (interviews, candidates, templates, analytics)
- Implemented IBM Plex Mono (headings) and Open Sans (body) fonts
- Added concurrently scripts for running both servers
- Created two-file documentation system (CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md + CLAUDE_CODE.md)
- Updated WORKFLOW.md with dependency check strategy

**Key Claude Interactions:**
1. **Initial Setup** - Generated complete project structure and configs (saved ~30 min)
2. **Biome Linting** - Auto-fixed 3,221 formatting errors (saved ~15 min)
3. **CSS Build Error** - Diagnosed missing Tailwind color classes in config (saved ~5 min)

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚ùå **Build Failure:** CSS used `text-foreground` class that didn't exist
  - **Fix:** Extended Tailwind config with foreground, border, muted colors
  - **Learning:** Production build stricter than dev server - always test builds early

- ‚ùå **Context Limit:** Hit 4% during setup phase
  - **Fix:** Created detailed handoff prompt for session continuity
  - **Learning:** Better session planning needed for long tasks

**Documentation Strategy Established:**
- `CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md` - Chronological log of ALL interactions (append as we go)
- `CLAUDE_CODE.md` - 8 required sections organized for submission (updated before commits)
- Only document significant interactions (Claude asks first)
- Update summary file before each commit

**Dependency Strategy:**
- Install dependencies as needed per feature (not all upfront)
- Reference PRD.md lines 14-23 for required tech stack
- Document each installation with justification

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~45 minutes (43% faster than manual)

### Task #2: Design System & shadcn/ui Configuration (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Time:** ~30 minutes
**Claude Effectiveness:** 10/10

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Fetched actual KeySingularity website (https://www.keysingularity.com/casi.php) to extract brand colors
- Configured shadcn/ui with CSS variables for theme system
- Updated Tailwind config with exact brand colors (#facc15 yellow, #f59e0b hover, #d97706 active)
- Set up complete CSS variable system for all theme tokens
- Added radial gradient background matching KeySingularity site
- Configured responsive typography (2.5rem mobile, 3.5rem desktop for h1)
- Installed 8 shadcn/ui components (button, card, table, input, select, badge, dialog, dropdown-menu)
- Created cn() utility function for className merging
- Added type-check script to package.json

**Key Claude Interactions:**
1. **WebFetch Tool** - Extracted exact brand colors from live website (saved ~10 min)
2. **CSS Variable System** - Generated complete theme token system (saved ~15 min)
3. **Component Installation** - Automated shadcn/ui setup with proper config (saved ~20 min)

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **Formatting Errors:** Biome flagged 16 files with quote style mismatches
  - **Fix:** Ran `npm run lint:fix` to auto-format all shadcn components
  - **Outcome:** All files formatted to project standards (single quotes, proper line breaks)

**Quality Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Lint: Passed (20 files checked)
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passed with no errors
- ‚úÖ Build: Successfully compiled production build
- ‚úÖ Dev server: Running on http://localhost:3000

**KeySingularity Brand Applied:**

### Task #3: Data Layer and State Management Setup (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Time:** ~25 minutes
**Claude Effectiveness:** 10/10

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Designed type safety architecture adapted from ShortCat monorepo patterns
- Created complete API type definitions (Interview, Candidate, Template, Analytics)
- Built Zod validation schemas for form inputs only (not API responses)
- Implemented typed API client with all 8 endpoints
- Set up TanStack Query with optimized caching strategy (5min staleTime, 10min gcTime)
- Created custom hooks for all endpoints with proper cache invalidation
- Built global app context for UI state (sidebar, theme)
- Integrated QueryProvider and AppProvider into root layout
- Added comprehensive type safety documentation to CLAUDE.md

**Key Claude Interactions:**
1. **Architecture Discussion** - Strategic analysis of type safety patterns (saved ~15 min)
   - Decision: Simple frontend-only pattern (no shared folder)
   - Zod for forms only, TypeScript for API responses
   - Reference docs from Shortcat analyzed for best practices

2. **Code Generation** - Created 12 files with ~550 lines of code (saved ~60 min)
   - types.ts (74 lines)
   - schemas.ts (72 lines) - NEW architecture decision
   - api.ts (121 lines)
   - 4 custom hook files (111 lines total)
   - Provider and context files (57 lines total)

3. **TypeScript Error Fix** - Caught and fixed type incompatibility (saved ~5 min)
   - User found: `CandidateFilters` not assignable to `Record<string, string | undefined>`
   - Claude fixed: Changed to `Record<string, unknown>` with runtime type guard

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety Error:** buildQueryString parameter type too restrictive
  - **Fix:** Used Record<string, unknown> with typeof guard for runtime safety
  - **Outcome:** Zero TypeScript errors, all type checks passing

**Quality Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Lint: 9 files auto-fixed (import ordering, formatting)
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passed with 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Build: Compiled successfully (87.2 kB bundle size)
- ‚úÖ Dev server: Running successfully on localhost:3002

**Dependencies Installed:**
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
```

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Single source of truth:** types.ts for all API data structures
- **Zod for validation:** Forms, CSV uploads, user input only
- **No runtime validation:** Trust our own API responses (performance)
- **Proper caching:** TanStack Query with strategic cache invalidation
- **Type-safe hooks:** All endpoints have typed React Query hooks

**Documentation Added:**
- Complete type safety section in CLAUDE.md (~200 lines)
- Philosophy: Zod for forms, TypeScript for API
- Patterns and anti-patterns
- Adding new types workflow

**Time Saved with Claude:** ~60 minutes (71% faster than manual implementation)

**Strategic Decision:**
Adapted Shortcat's comprehensive monorepo type safety patterns to a simpler single-app architecture. This demonstrates critical thinking about when to scale down complex patterns for appropriate project scope.

## Technical Decisions

### Pre-Planning: Company Research & Analysis

Before selecting the tech stack, I:
- **Analyzed KeySingularity's website and AI interview product** to understand their brand identity and technical context
- **Reviewed the original requirements** which estimated 7-10 hours for features (without planning time allocated)
- **Identified brand elements:** #facc15 (yellow), #0D121C (dark), IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans fonts
- **Recognized data-heavy dashboard needs:** Complex tables, charts, filtering - perfect for TanStack ecosystem

This research informed all subsequent technical decisions.

### Tech Stack Rationale

**Next.js 14 over Vite:**
- Routing included out of the box (saves 1-2 hours of configuration)
- One-click Vercel deployment (critical for live demo)
- SSR/SSG capabilities if needed
- Familiar ecosystem from production experience

**TypeScript (strict mode):**
- Explicitly required in assignment
- My core specialty
- Enables type-safe development end-to-end

**shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS:**
- Pre-built accessible components (Table, Dialog, Form, etc.)
- Saves 3-4 hours vs. building from scratch
- Professional look automatic
- Already mastered in ShortCat project
- Easy to customize with KeySingularity brand colors

**Recharts over TanStack Charts:**
- Mature library (since 2016) with excellent Claude Code support
- TanStack Charts too recent - Claude unfamiliar with it
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Production-proven in similar dashboards

**TanStack Table v8:**
- Mentioned in requirements document
- Perfect for complex filtering/sorting/pagination
- Headless design integrates seamlessly with shadcn
- Industry standard for data-heavy interfaces

**TanStack Query:**
- Automatic caching and data fetching optimization
- Successfully used in ShortCat production project
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reduces boilerplate significantly

**Context API over Zustand:**
- Project needs are simple: filters state, form state, mock session
- Don't add complexity where it's not needed
- Claude Code handles Context patterns perfectly
- Easier to understand for code review

**React Hook Form + Zod:**
- Proven stack from ShortCat
- Type-safe validation end-to-end
- Centralized schemas in `/lib/schemas`
- Claude Code generates excellent form code

**Biome over ESLint:**
- Used successfully in previous role
- Faster and simpler configuration
- Modern alternative with better DX

**Vitest + React Testing Library:**
- My testing stack from ShortCat
- Selective coverage (60-70%) on critical logic
- Focus on business logic, not UI snapshots
- Claude Code generates good test boilerplate

### Architecture Choices
- **Monorepo Structure:** No - Simple `api/` and `frontend/` folders per requirements
- **State Management:** Context API - Sufficient for interview dashboard scope
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query - Better caching and state management
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form + Zod - Type-safe validation
- **Testing:** Vitest with selective coverage - Focus on critical paths only

### Trade-offs Made
- **Speed vs Perfection:** Prioritizing functional features over polish
- **Documentation vs Code:** 30% grade on docs, so heavy documentation focus
- **Custom vs Library:** Using shadcn/ui to save component development time
- **Testing Coverage:** 60% on critical paths vs 100% coverage

### What I'd Do Differently (If More Time)
- Add E2E tests with Playwright
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add performance optimizations (virtualization)
- Create custom design system
- Add more animations/transitions

## Development Process

### Workflow Innovation
Using Task Master AI from my ShortCat experience - this is my key differentiator:
- Automated task tracking
- Enforced documentation updates
- Quality gates at each step
- Clear approval workflow

### Git Strategy
- Conventional commits showing progression
- Minimum 5 meaningful commits
- Commit after each completed feature
- Clear history of development process

### Documentation Strategy
- **CLAUDE_CODE.md:** Detailed AI interactions (updated continuously)
- **DEVELOPMENT.md:** High-level summary (updated before commits)
- **README.md:** Setup instructions (final)

## Lessons Learned

### Prompt Engineering
- Provide complete context upfront
- Be explicit about constraints
- Use production examples as reference
- Iterate with specific feedback

### AI Collaboration
- Claude excels at scaffolding
- Needs guidance on specific requirements
- Quick to correct with clear feedback
- Documentation generation is excellent

### Time Management
- Setup phase critical for success
- Don't over-engineer early features
- Leave time for documentation
- Test as you go, not at the end
