# Claude Code Usage Documentation

**Project:** AI Interview Dashboard - Technical Assessment for DaCodes
**Developer:** Javier Criado
**AI Assistant:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Documentation Strategy:** Detailed chronological log maintained in `CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md`, organized summary in this file

---

## 1. Setup & Scaffolding

### Initial Project Structure

**My Prompt:**
```
"Help me initialize the AI Interview Dashboard project following the tech stack in PRD.md:
- Next.js 14 with App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with KeySingularity branding (#facc15 yellow, #0D121C dark)
- Biome for linting (NOT ESLint)
- Mock Express API server in /api folder
- Directory structure matching technical-task-requirements.md"
```

**Claude's Approach:**
1. Created root-level structure with `api/` and `frontend/` folders
2. Generated Next.js 14 project manually (avoiding CLI conflicts)
3. Set up Biome configuration with recommended rules
4. Configured Tailwind with custom colors and fonts
5. Created mock API server with all required endpoints

**What Claude Generated:**
- ✅ Complete `package.json` for both frontend and root
- ✅ TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- ✅ Tailwind config with KeySingularity brand colors
- ✅ Biome configuration (`biome.json`)
- ✅ Mock API server with 8 endpoints (interviews, candidates, templates, analytics)
- ✅ Next.js App Router structure (`app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Global CSS with brand fonts (IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans)

**My Modifications:**
- Added `concurrently` script to run both API and frontend servers simultaneously
- Extended Tailwind color palette with `foreground`, `border`, and `muted` colors (discovered during build)
- Adjusted directory structure to match requirements exactly

**Time Saved:** ~30 minutes of boilerplate setup

**Effectiveness:** 9/10 (Manual setup avoided CLI conflicts, but required careful configuration)

## 2. Component Development

### Task #2: Design System & shadcn/ui Setup

**Context:** Configure complete design system with KeySingularity branding and install shadcn/ui component library
**Task ID:** #2 from Task Master

**My Initial Prompt:**
```
"I'm working on the AI Interview Dashboard.

1. Check next/in-progress task: task-master next
2. Confirm you've read WORKFLOW.md
3. Show TodoWrite with all workflow steps (1-13) for my approval
4. Then proceed with the task"
```

**Follow-up Request:**
```
"Please check https://www.keysingularity.com/casi.php and update the color schemas
and fonts to be used so we use the same colors, fonts, font sizes, same look and feel
of the corporate brand owner of this requirement"
```

**Claude's Approach:**
1. Created 13-step TodoWrite tracking workflow from WORKFLOW.md
2. Fetched actual KeySingularity website to extract brand colors and typography
3. Generated shadcn/ui configuration with CSS variables
4. Updated Tailwind config to use KeySingularity exact colors
5. Created utility function for className merging
6. Installed all dependencies and shadcn/ui components

**What Claude Generated:**

**File 1:** `components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

**File 2:** `src/lib/utils.ts` - cn() utility
```typescript
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

**File 3:** Updated `tailwind.config.ts` with:
- KeySingularity exact colors (primary: #facc15, hover: #f59e0b, active: #d97706)
- CSS variable system for shadcn/ui
- Custom font sizes (2.5rem mobile, 3.5rem desktop for h1)
- Background gradients (radial-gradient-dark)
- Border radius variables

**File 4:** Updated `globals.css` with:
- Complete CSS variable definitions matching KeySingularity brand
- Radial gradient background (#1a202c to #0D121C)
- Text shadow for headings (0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3))
- Custom utility classes (.button-primary, .card-dark)

**File 5:** Installed dependencies:
- clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority
- lucide-react, tailwindcss-animate
- shadcn/ui components: button, card, table, input, select, badge, dialog, dropdown-menu

**KeySingularity Brand Colors Extracted:**
- Primary: #facc15 (true yellow)
- Hover: #f59e0b
- Active: #d97706
- Background: #0D121C with radial gradient
- Secondary BG: #1a202c
- Border: #374151
- Text: #ffffff (primary), #d1d5db (secondary), #9ca3af (muted)

**My Review Before Save:**
- ✅ Verified all colors match actual KeySingularity website
- ✅ Confirmed font families (IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans)
- ✅ Checked font sizes and responsive breakpoints
- ✅ Approved utility classes and CSS variable naming

**Issues Found During Validation:**
1. **Biome Formatting Errors** (16 files)
   - Error: Shadcn/ui components use double quotes, project uses single quotes
   - Solution: Ran `npm run lint:fix` to auto-format all files
   - Outcome: ✅ All 10 files fixed automatically

**Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Lint: Passed (after auto-fix)
- ✅ Type-check: Passed
- ✅ Build: Compiled successfully
- ✅ Dev server: Running on http://localhost:3000

**Result:** ✅ Complete design system configured with exact KeySingularity branding

**Time Saved:** ~45 minutes
- Manual WebFetch of brand colors: ~10 min saved
- CSS variable setup: ~15 min saved
- shadcn/ui installation and config: ~20 min saved

**Effectiveness:** 10/10

**What Worked Perfectly:**
- WebFetch tool extracted exact brand colors from live website
- CSS variable system properly integrates shadcn/ui with custom brand
- Auto-fix handled all formatting issues instantly
- Quality checks caught no errors

**What Required Iteration:**
- None - implementation worked on first try after user approval

---

### Task #1: Project Initialization (No components yet)

**Status:** Components will be documented starting with Task #3 (Interview List View)

**Preparation:**
- shadcn/ui components are now available for use
- Each major feature component will be documented with specific prompts and iterations

---

## 3. Debugging & Problem Solving

### Issue 1: Biome Linting - 3,221 Formatting Errors

**Error Message:**
```bash
npm run lint
Checked 10 files. Fixed 3221 files.
```

**My Prompt to Claude:**
```
"Run Biome linter and fix all formatting errors. There are 3,221+ issues."
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Used `biome check --write .` to auto-fix formatting issues across all files.

**Outcome:** ✅ All 3,221 errors fixed automatically
**Time Saved:** ~15 minutes of manual formatting
**Effectiveness:** 10/10 (Biome auto-fix worked perfectly)

---

### Issue 2: CSS Syntax Error - Missing Tailwind Classes

**Error Message:**
```bash
npm run build

Failed to compile.
./src/app/globals.css:1:1
Syntax error: The `text-foreground` class does not exist.
If `text-foreground` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

**Context:**
Dev server ran fine, but production build failed. Used `@apply bg-background text-foreground` in CSS but these utility classes weren't defined in Tailwind config.

**My Prompt to Claude:**
```
"Fix CSS syntax errors. Build failing because text-foreground and bg-background
classes don't exist in Tailwind config."
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Extended `tailwind.config.ts` with proper color definitions:

```typescript
colors: {
  foreground: {
    DEFAULT: '#f8fafc',
    muted: '#94a3b8',
  },
  border: '#334155',
  muted: '#1e293b',
}
```

**What Worked:**
- Build process caught what dev server missed (good validation)
- Claude immediately identified root cause (Tailwind config)
- Fix was straightforward and followed best practices

**Outcome:** ✅ Production build successful
**Time Saved:** ~5 minutes
**Effectiveness:** 10/10 (Perfect diagnosis)

---

### Issue 3: Context Limit Management

**Challenge:**
Reached 4% context remaining during Task #1 setup. Needed to continue work in fresh session without losing progress.

**My Request:**
```
"You have only 4% of context. Give me a prompt to continue in a cleared
Claude Code window with this task. It ain't completed yet. Let's use
WORKFLOW.md as reference."
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Generated comprehensive handoff prompt with:
- Current task status and progress
- Completed workflow steps (9/12)
- Remaining issues and next actions
- Critical requirements and constraints

**Outcome:** ✅ Seamless session transition with no lost context
**Learning:** Creating detailed handoff prompts ensures continuity across sessions
**Effectiveness:** 9/10 (Required manual copy-paste, but preserved all context)

---

## 4. Testing

**Status:** Testing implementation will begin with Task #2

**Strategy:**
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Selective high-impact tests only (per requirements)
- Tests will be documented as they're added

---

## 5. Iteration Examples

### Iteration: Tailwind Color Configuration

**First Attempt:**
Claude set up basic Tailwind config with `primary` and `background` colors only.

**Issue Discovered:**
Production build failed due to missing `foreground`, `border`, and `muted` color utilities used in `globals.css`.

**Second Iteration:**
```
"Build is failing. Need to add foreground, border, and muted colors to Tailwind config."
```

**Result:** ✅ Extended color palette successfully
**Learning:** Production builds are stricter than dev - always test builds early
**Refinement:** Now validating with `npm run build` before marking tasks complete

---

## 6. Critical Review

### Decision: Manual Next.js Setup vs. create-next-app

**Claude's Initial Suggestion:**
Use `create-next-app` CLI for quick setup.

**My Concern:**
CLI might conflict with existing directory structure and Biome preferences.

**My Decision:**
Manual setup with explicit configuration files.

**Why I Chose Differently:**
- More control over exact dependencies and versions
- Avoided potential ESLint conflicts (we're using Biome)
- Better alignment with requirements
- Clearer documentation of what was set up

**Outcome:** ✅ Clean setup with no conflicts
**Trade-off:** ~10 more minutes of setup time, but better understanding of structure

---

### Code Review: API Mock Endpoints

**Claude's Generated Code:**
Mock API endpoints used simple in-memory arrays with immediate responses.

**What I Verified:**
- ✅ All 8 required endpoints present
- ✅ Response shapes match expected frontend needs
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ CORS configured correctly

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Mock data is minimal (will expand when building actual features)
- No error scenarios yet (will add during integration)

**Decision:** Accept as-is for Task #1, enhance during feature development
**Rationale:** Matches "get started quickly" goal, can iterate later

## 8. What Didn't Work

### Challenges and Limitations

1. **Initial Dependency Strategy (Ambiguity)**
   - **Issue:** PRD specified many dependencies (shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Recharts, etc.)
   - **Claude's Approach:** Didn't install them during Task #1
   - **My Concern:** Were they needed for "project initialization"?
   - **Resolution:** Decided to install dependencies as needed per feature
   - **Learning:** Need clearer task-level dependency requirements upfront

2. **Context Window Management (Limitation)**
   - **Issue:** Hit 4% context during Task #1 setup
   - **Workaround:** Created handoff prompt for new session
   - **Impact:** Manual copy-paste required, some context loss
   - **Improvement Needed:** Better session planning for long tasks

3. **Build vs. Dev Server Discrepancy (Missed Check)**
   - **Issue:** Dev server didn't catch missing Tailwind classes
   - **Claude's Initial Check:** Only ran dev server, not build
   - **Resolution:** Added `npm run build` to quality checklist
   - **Learning:** Always run production build before marking tasks complete

### What I Had to Do Manually

1. **Session Transition:**
   - Manually copied handoff prompt to new session
   - Re-established context about task status

2. **Documentation Organization:**
   - Decided on two-file system (CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md + CLAUDE_CODE.md)
   - Claude suggested it, but I structured the approach

3. **Dependency Strategy Decision:**
   - Chose "install as needed" approach
   - Will document in WORKFLOW.md
