# Claude Code Usage Documentation

**Project:** AI Interview Dashboard - Technical Assessment for DaCodes
**Developer:** Javier Criado
**AI Assistant:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Documentation Strategy:** Detailed chronological log maintained in `CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md`, organized summary in this file

---

## 1. Setup & Scaffolding

### Initial Project Structure

**My Prompt:**
```
"Help me initialize the AI Interview Dashboard project following the tech stack in PRD.md:
- Next.js 14 with App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with KeySingularity branding (#facc15 yellow, #0D121C dark)
- Biome for linting (NOT ESLint)
- Mock Express API server in /api folder
- Directory structure matching technical-task-requirements.md"
```

**Claude's Approach:**
1. Created root-level structure with `api/` and `frontend/` folders
2. Generated Next.js 14 project manually (avoiding CLI conflicts)
3. Set up Biome configuration with recommended rules
4. Configured Tailwind with custom colors and fonts
5. Created mock API server with all required endpoints

**What Claude Generated:**
- ✅ Complete `package.json` for both frontend and root
- ✅ TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- ✅ Tailwind config with KeySingularity brand colors
- ✅ Biome configuration (`biome.json`)
- ✅ Mock API server with 8 endpoints (interviews, candidates, templates, analytics)
- ✅ Next.js App Router structure (`app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Global CSS with brand fonts (IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans)

**My Modifications:**
- Added `concurrently` script to run both API and frontend servers simultaneously
- Extended Tailwind color palette with `foreground`, `border`, and `muted` colors (discovered during build)
- Adjusted directory structure to match requirements exactly

**Time Saved:** ~30 minutes of boilerplate setup

**Effectiveness:** 9/10 (Manual setup avoided CLI conflicts, but required careful configuration)

## 2. Component Development

### Task #2: Design System & shadcn/ui Setup

**Context:** Configure complete design system with KeySingularity branding and install shadcn/ui component library
**Task ID:** #2 from Task Master

**My Initial Prompt:**
```
"I'm working on the AI Interview Dashboard.

1. Check next/in-progress task: task-master next
2. Confirm you've read WORKFLOW.md
3. Show TodoWrite with all workflow steps (1-13) for my approval
4. Then proceed with the task"
```

**Follow-up Request:**
```
"Please check https://www.keysingularity.com/casi.php and update the color schemas
and fonts to be used so we use the same colors, fonts, font sizes, same look and feel
of the corporate brand owner of this requirement"
```

**Claude's Approach:**
1. Created 13-step TodoWrite tracking workflow from WORKFLOW.md
2. Fetched actual KeySingularity website to extract brand colors and typography
3. Generated shadcn/ui configuration with CSS variables
4. Updated Tailwind config to use KeySingularity exact colors
5. Created utility function for className merging
6. Installed all dependencies and shadcn/ui components

**What Claude Generated:**

**File 1:** `components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

**File 2:** `src/lib/utils.ts` - cn() utility
```typescript
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

**File 3:** Updated `tailwind.config.ts` with:
- KeySingularity exact colors (primary: #facc15, hover: #f59e0b, active: #d97706)
- CSS variable system for shadcn/ui
- Custom font sizes (2.5rem mobile, 3.5rem desktop for h1)
- Background gradients (radial-gradient-dark)
- Border radius variables

**File 4:** Updated `globals.css` with:
- Complete CSS variable definitions matching KeySingularity brand
- Radial gradient background (#1a202c to #0D121C)
- Text shadow for headings (0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3))
- Custom utility classes (.button-primary, .card-dark)

**File 5:** Installed dependencies:
- clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority
- lucide-react, tailwindcss-animate
- shadcn/ui components: button, card, table, input, select, badge, dialog, dropdown-menu

**KeySingularity Brand Colors Extracted:**
- Primary: #facc15 (true yellow)
- Hover: #f59e0b
- Active: #d97706
- Background: #0D121C with radial gradient
- Secondary BG: #1a202c
- Border: #374151
- Text: #ffffff (primary), #d1d5db (secondary), #9ca3af (muted)

**My Review Before Save:**
- ✅ Verified all colors match actual KeySingularity website
- ✅ Confirmed font families (IBM Plex Mono, Open Sans)
- ✅ Checked font sizes and responsive breakpoints
- ✅ Approved utility classes and CSS variable naming

**Issues Found During Validation:**
1. **Biome Formatting Errors** (16 files)
   - Error: Shadcn/ui components use double quotes, project uses single quotes
   - Solution: Ran `npm run lint:fix` to auto-format all files
   - Outcome: ✅ All 10 files fixed automatically

**Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Lint: Passed (after auto-fix)
- ✅ Type-check: Passed
- ✅ Build: Compiled successfully
- ✅ Dev server: Running on http://localhost:3000

**Result:** ✅ Complete design system configured with exact KeySingularity branding

**Time Saved:** ~45 minutes
- Manual WebFetch of brand colors: ~10 min saved
- CSS variable setup: ~15 min saved
- shadcn/ui installation and config: ~20 min saved

**Effectiveness:** 10/10

**What Worked Perfectly:**
- WebFetch tool extracted exact brand colors from live website
- CSS variable system properly integrates shadcn/ui with custom brand
- Auto-fix handled all formatting issues instantly
- Quality checks caught no errors

**What Required Iteration:**
- None - implementation worked on first try after user approval

---

### Task #3: Data Layer and State Management Setup

**Context:** Setup complete data architecture with type safety patterns, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod
**Task ID:** #3 from Task Master (Complexity: 5/10, Priority: High)

**Architecture Discussion Prompt:**
```
"Should we use Opus for tasks >= 5 complexity? What about type safety patterns - should they be in a shared folder like my Shortcat project? I want to document our Zod strategy similar to: docs/references/zod-and-prisma.md"
```

**Claude's Strategic Analysis:**
1. **Model Choice:** Use Opus only for complexity >= 6 (this task is 5, Sonnet is fine)
2. **Type Safety:** Single `types.ts` in frontend (no shared folder for this simple project)
3. **Zod Strategy:** Validation for forms only, not API responses (trust our own backend)

**Implementation Prompt:**
```
"Implement complete data layer following these principles:
- types.ts for all API data structures (single source of truth)
- schemas.ts for Zod form validation only
- api.ts with typed client functions
- TanStack Query hooks for all endpoints
- Global app context for UI state"
```

**What Claude Generated:**

**12 Files Created:**
1. `types.ts` (74 lines) - Interview, Candidate, Template, Analytics types + filters
2. `schemas.ts` (72 lines) - Zod schemas with validation messages
3. `api.ts` (121 lines) - Complete API client with all 8 endpoints
4. `providers/query-provider.tsx` (26 lines) - TanStack Query setup
5. `hooks/use-interviews.ts` (24 lines) - Interview query hooks
6. `hooks/use-candidates.ts` (45 lines) - Candidate hooks with mutations
7. `hooks/use-templates.ts` (30 lines) - Template query hooks
8. `hooks/use-analytics.ts` (12 lines) - Analytics hook
9. `hooks/index.ts` (5 lines) - Export barrel
10. `context/app-context.tsx` (31 lines) - Global state
11. `app/layout.tsx` (UPDATED) - Provider integration
12. `CLAUDE.md` (UPDATED) - Type safety architecture documentation section

**User Review & Iteration:**
```
User: "Found one TypeScript error in api.ts at line 27 and 51:
Argument of type 'CandidateFilters' not assignable to 'Record<string, string | undefined>'"
```

**Claude's Fix:**
Changed `buildQueryString()` parameter type from `Record<string, string | undefined>` to `Record<string, unknown>` with runtime type guard checking `typeof value === 'string'`

**Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Lint: 9 files auto-fixed (import ordering)
- ✅ Type-check: 0 errors
- ✅ Build: Compiled successfully (87.2 kB bundle)
- ✅ Dev: Started successfully

**Result:** ✅ Production-quality data layer with complete type safety

**Architecture Decisions Documented:**
Added comprehensive type safety section to CLAUDE.md covering:
- Philosophy (Zod for forms, TypeScript for API)
- File organization patterns
- When to use Zod vs TypeScript
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Adding new types workflow

**Time Saved:** ~60 minutes
- Type definitions: ~10 min saved
- API client functions: ~15 min saved
- TanStack Query hooks: ~20 min saved
- Zod schemas: ~10 min saved
- Documentation: ~5 min saved

**Effectiveness:** 10/10

**What Worked Perfectly:**
- Strategic architecture discussion led to optimal simple pattern
- Reference docs (type-safety.md, zod-and-prisma.md) provided clear guidance
- All code generated correctly on first try
- User caught TypeScript error before quality checks (good review)
- Fix was immediate and correct

**What Required Iteration:**
- One TypeScript error in buildQueryString type signature (fixed in <1 min)

### Task #4: Interview List View with Filtering

**Context:** Implement interview dashboard with TanStack Table, filters, search, and navigation
**Task ID:** #4 from Task Master (Complexity: 6/10)

**Initial Implementation Prompt:**
```
"Implement InterviewList component with:
- TanStack Table with sortable columns
- Date range picker, position and status filters
- Debounced search with useDeferredValue
- Row click navigation to detail view
- Loading skeletons and error states"
```

**What Claude Generated:**
- Complete InterviewList component with all features
- Calendar date range picker
- Select dropdowns for filters
- Debounced search implementation
- Full TypeScript typing

**Critical Issues Found by User:**

**Issue #1: Type Assertions Instead of Proper Types**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: What Claude initially generated
const date = row.getValue('completedAt') as string;
const score = row.getValue('score') as number;

// ✅ GOOD: User correction - use typed original data
const date = row.original.completedAt;
const score = row.original.score;
```

**User Feedback:** "We have all the types defined in types.ts - shouldn't you be using defined types instead of 'as'?"

**Issue #2: Creating Custom Calendar Instead of Using shadcn/ui**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Claude tried to create custom Calendar component
function Calendar({ className, ...props }: CalendarProps) {
  // Custom implementation
}

// ✅ GOOD: Use existing shadcn/ui component
npx shadcn@latest add calendar
```

**User Feedback:** "Isn't there already a shadcn calendar? CLAUDE.md specifies to always use shadcn components"

**Issue #3: Empty String Values in Select Components**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Empty string not allowed in SelectItem
<SelectItem value="">All positions</SelectItem>

// ✅ GOOD: Use "all" as special value
<SelectItem value="all">All positions</SelectItem>
```

**Documentation Updates Made:**
- Added "Component Pattern" section to CLAUDE.md Implementation Patterns
- Updated WORKFLOW.md Step 2 to emphasize using shadcn/ui components

**Result:** ✅ Working InterviewList with all features after corrections

**Time Investment:** ~30 minutes (including fixes)
**Effectiveness:** 8/10 (required corrections but quick to fix)

**Key Learnings:**
1. Always use `row.original` for typed data access in TanStack Table
2. Check shadcn/ui library before creating any custom components
3. Select components require non-empty string values
4. Type safety should leverage existing type definitions, not assertions

---

### Task #5: Interview Detail View with Charts

**Context:** Build comprehensive interview detail page with Recharts radar chart, transcript display, mock audio player, and notes with localStorage
**Task ID:** #5 from Task Master (Complexity: 5/10)

**Initial Implementation Prompt:**
```
"I'm working on the AI Interview Dashboard.

1. Check next/in-progress task: task-master next
2. Confirm you've read WORKFLOW.md
3. Show TodoWrite with all workflow steps (1-13) for my approval
4. Then proceed with the task"
```

**Claude's Approach:**
1. Created 13-step TodoWrite tracking complete workflow
2. Installed Recharts library for competency visualization
3. Added shadcn/ui Textarea component for notes
4. Implemented complete detail page with all required features
5. Used proper type safety patterns (`Interview['status']` not `typeof`)

**What Claude Generated:**

**File 1:** `src/app/interviews/[id]/page.tsx` (348 lines)
- Back navigation with arrow button to interview list
- Header card with candidate info, status badges, key metrics
- Two-column responsive layout (competency/audio left, transcript/notes right)
- Competency radar chart with KeySingularity brand colors (#facc15)
- Competency score list with progress bars
- Mock audio player with play/pause, timeline, volume controls
- Scrollable transcript display with paragraph formatting
- Notes textarea with localStorage auto-save
- Loading skeletons and error states
- Proper type imports and usage

**User Review - Type Safety Correction:**

**Issue Found:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: What Claude initially generated
const statusColors: Record<typeof interview.status, string> = {
  scheduled: 'bg-blue-500/10 text-blue-500',
  ...
};
```

**User Feedback:**
"You're using `typeof interview.status` where you should import the Interview type and use `Interview['status']`. Check CLAUDE.md type safety patterns and interview-list.tsx for examples."

**Claude's Fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Proper type import and usage
import type { Interview } from '@/lib/types';

const statusColors: Record<Interview['status'], string> = {
  scheduled: 'bg-blue-500/10 text-blue-500',
  in_progress: 'bg-yellow-500/10 text-yellow-500',
  completed: 'bg-green-500/10 text-green-500',
  cancelled: 'bg-red-500/10 text-red-500',
};
```

**Documentation Update:**
Added type safety reminder to WORKFLOW.md Step 2:
```markdown
- **Type Safety**: ALWAYS import and use types from `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`
  - Use `Interview['status']` instead of `typeof interview.status`
  - Reference `interview-list.tsx` for examples
```

**Quality Check Issues:**

**Issue #1: Lint - Array Index Keys (My Code)**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Using index as key
interview.transcript.split('\n\n').map((paragraph, index) => (
  <p key={index}>
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Content-based unique key
interview.transcript.split('\n\n').map((paragraph) => (
  <p key={`${paragraph.substring(0, 50)}-${paragraph.length}`}>
```

**Issue #2: Lint - Pre-existing Skeleton Keys (interview-list.tsx)**
Fixed pre-existing lint errors from Task #4 by generating keys in Array.from:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Generate keys without using index in map callback
Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `skeleton-row-${i}`).map((rowKey, i) => (
  <TableRow key={rowKey}>
```

**Quality Checks Final Results:**
- ✅ Lint: Passed (all errors fixed including pre-existing)
- ✅ Type-check: Passed
- ✅ Build: Passed successfully
- ✅ Dev: Compiled without errors

**Result:** ✅ Production-ready interview detail view with all features

**Time Saved:** ~50 minutes
- Recharts radar chart setup: ~15 min saved
- Mock audio player UI: ~10 min saved
- Transcript formatting: ~5 min saved
- localStorage integration: ~10 min saved
- Responsive layout: ~10 min saved

**Effectiveness:** 9/10

**What Worked Perfectly:**
- All shadcn/ui components worked out of the box
- Recharts integrated smoothly with brand colors
- localStorage persistence worked immediately
- Responsive grid layout adapted well to mobile

**What Required Iteration:**
- Type safety pattern correction (typeof → Interview['status'])
- Array index key warning (content-based keys)
- Fixed pre-existing lint issues for clean build

**Key Learnings:**
1. Always import and use defined types from `types.ts`
2. Use `Type['field']` bracket notation for union type subsets
3. Avoid array index keys - use content-based unique identifiers
4. Run full quality checks to catch pre-existing issues

## 3. Debugging & Problem Solving

### Issue 1: Biome Linting - 3,221 Formatting Errors

**Error Message:**
```bash
npm run lint
Checked 10 files. Fixed 3221 files.
```

**My Prompt to Claude:**
```
"Run Biome linter and fix all formatting errors. There are 3,221+ issues."
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Used `biome check --write .` to auto-fix formatting issues across all files.

**Outcome:** ✅ All 3,221 errors fixed automatically
**Time Saved:** ~15 minutes of manual formatting
**Effectiveness:** 10/10 (Biome auto-fix worked perfectly)

---

### Issue 2: CSS Syntax Error - Missing Tailwind Classes

**Error Message:**
```bash
npm run build

Failed to compile.
./src/app/globals.css:1:1
Syntax error: The `text-foreground` class does not exist.
If `text-foreground` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

**Context:**
Dev server ran fine, but production build failed. Used `@apply bg-background text-foreground` in CSS but these utility classes weren't defined in Tailwind config.

**My Prompt to Claude:**
```
"Fix CSS syntax errors. Build failing because text-foreground and bg-background
classes don't exist in Tailwind config."
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Extended `tailwind.config.ts` with proper color definitions:

```typescript
colors: {
  foreground: {
    DEFAULT: '#f8fafc',
    muted: '#94a3b8',
  },
  border: '#334155',
  muted: '#1e293b',
}
```

**What Worked:**
- Build process caught what dev server missed (good validation)
- Claude immediately identified root cause (Tailwind config)
- Fix was straightforward and followed best practices

**Outcome:** ✅ Production build successful
**Time Saved:** ~5 minutes
**Effectiveness:** 10/10 (Perfect diagnosis)

---

### Issue 3: Context Limit Management

**Challenge:**
Reached 4% context remaining during Task #1 setup. Needed to continue work in fresh session without losing progress.

**My Request:**
```
"You have only 4% of context. Give me a prompt to continue in a cleared
Claude Code window with this task. It ain't completed yet. Let's use
WORKFLOW.md as reference."
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Generated comprehensive handoff prompt with:
- Current task status and progress
- Completed workflow steps (9/12)
- Remaining issues and next actions
- Critical requirements and constraints

**Outcome:** ✅ Seamless session transition with no lost context
**Learning:** Creating detailed handoff prompts ensures continuity across sessions
**Effectiveness:** 9/10 (Required manual copy-paste, but preserved all context)

---

### Issue 4: Select Component Empty String Error

**Error Message:**
```
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.
This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the
selection and show the placeholder.
```

**Context:**
Task #4 - InterviewList component filters used empty strings for "All" options

**My Feedback to Claude:**
```
"When I run npm run dev and go to http://localhost:3000/interviews I get this error:
A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string"
```

**Claude's Solution:**
Changed empty string values to "all" as a special value:

```typescript
// Before (causing error)
<Select value={filters.jobPosition || ''}>
  <SelectItem value="">All positions</SelectItem>
</Select>

// After (fixed)
<Select value={filters.jobPosition || 'all'}>
  <SelectItem value="all">All positions</SelectItem>
</Select>

// Handler updated to handle "all" value
onValueChange={(value) =>
  setFilters({ ...filters, jobPosition: value === 'all' ? undefined : value })
}
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Select components working properly
**Time Saved:** ~5 minutes (immediate fix)
**Effectiveness:** 10/10 (Clear error message, straightforward fix)
**Learning:** Radix UI Select components have strict validation - no empty strings allowed

---

## 4. Testing

**Status:** Testing implementation will begin with Task #2

**Strategy:**
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Selective high-impact tests only (per requirements)
- Tests will be documented as they're added

---

## 5. Iteration Examples

### Iteration: Tailwind Color Configuration

**First Attempt:**
Claude set up basic Tailwind config with `primary` and `background` colors only.

**Issue Discovered:**
Production build failed due to missing `foreground`, `border`, and `muted` color utilities used in `globals.css`.

**Second Iteration:**
```
"Build is failing. Need to add foreground, border, and muted colors to Tailwind config."
```

**Result:** ✅ Extended color palette successfully
**Learning:** Production builds are stricter than dev - always test builds early
**Refinement:** Now validating with `npm run build` before marking tasks complete

---

## 6. Critical Review

### Decision: Manual Next.js Setup vs. create-next-app

**Claude's Initial Suggestion:**
Use `create-next-app` CLI for quick setup.

**My Concern:**
CLI might conflict with existing directory structure and Biome preferences.

**My Decision:**
Manual setup with explicit configuration files.

**Why I Chose Differently:**
- More control over exact dependencies and versions
- Avoided potential ESLint conflicts (we're using Biome)
- Better alignment with requirements
- Clearer documentation of what was set up

**Outcome:** ✅ Clean setup with no conflicts
**Trade-off:** ~10 more minutes of setup time, but better understanding of structure

---

### Type Safety Pattern Review (Task #4)

**Claude's Initial Approach:**
Used type assertions (`as`) throughout TanStack Table implementation:
```typescript
const date = row.getValue('completedAt') as string;
const score = row.getValue('score') as number;
```

**User's Critical Observation:**
"We have all the types defined in types.ts - shouldn't you be using defined types?"

**Why This Matters:**
1. Type assertions bypass TypeScript's type checking
2. We already have proper types defined
3. `row.original` provides fully typed access
4. Type assertions can hide potential runtime errors

**Corrected Pattern:**
```typescript
const date = row.original.completedAt;  // Properly typed as string
const score = row.original.score;        // Properly typed as number
```

**Documentation Impact:**
Updated CLAUDE.md with explicit type safety patterns and anti-patterns section

**Learning:** Always leverage existing type definitions rather than asserting types

---

### Component Strategy Review (Task #4)

**Claude's Mistake:**
Attempted to create custom Calendar component from scratch despite shadcn/ui being available

**User's Critical Feedback:**
"Isn't there already a shadcn calendar component? CLAUDE.md specifies to always use Shadcn components"

**Why This Was Wrong:**
1. Violated documented project standards
2. Wasted time recreating existing functionality
3. Custom component wouldn't match design system
4. shadcn/ui components are already tested and accessible

**Corrected Approach:**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add calendar
```

**Documentation Updates:**
1. Added "Component Pattern" section to CLAUDE.md Implementation Patterns
2. Updated WORKFLOW.md Step 2 with shadcn/ui emphasis
3. Made it explicit: "ALWAYS use shadcn/ui when available"

**Impact:** Saved ~20 minutes of custom component development
**Learning:** Check component library before building custom solutions

---

### Code Review: API Mock Endpoints

**Claude's Generated Code:**
Mock API endpoints used simple in-memory arrays with immediate responses.

**What I Verified:**
- ✅ All 8 required endpoints present
- ✅ Response shapes match expected frontend needs
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ CORS configured correctly

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Mock data is minimal (will expand when building actual features)
- No error scenarios yet (will add during integration)

**Decision:** Accept as-is for Task #1, enhance during feature development
**Rationale:** Matches "get started quickly" goal, can iterate later

---

## 7. What Worked Well

### Strengths of Claude Code for This Project

   - "Use Biome NOT ESLint" prevented wrong tool setup
   - "Match technical-task-requirements.md structure" ensured compliance

2. **Reference Context Files:**
   - "@PRD.md" and "@WORKFLOW.md" references helped Claude understand requirements
   - Reduced back-and-forth clarifications

3. **Request Verification Steps:**
   - "Run build to verify" caught issues early
   - "List what was changed" helped with documentation

---

## 8. What Didn't Work

### Challenges and Limitations

1. **Initial Dependency Strategy (Ambiguity)**
   - **Issue:** PRD specified many dependencies (shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Recharts, etc.)
   - **Claude's Approach:** Didn't install them during Task #1
   - **My Concern:** Were they needed for "project initialization"?
   - **Resolution:** Decided to install dependencies as needed per feature
   - **Learning:** Need clearer task-level dependency requirements upfront

2. **Context Window Management (Limitation)**
   - **Issue:** Hit 4% context during Task #1 setup
   - **Workaround:** Created handoff prompt for new session
   - **Impact:** Manual copy-paste required, some context loss
   - **Improvement Needed:** Better session planning for long tasks

3. **Build vs. Dev Server Discrepancy (Missed Check)**
   - **Issue:** Dev server didn't catch missing Tailwind classes
   - **Claude's Initial Check:** Only ran dev server, not build
   - **Resolution:** Added `npm run build` to quality checklist
   - **Learning:** Always run production build before marking tasks complete

### What I Had to Do Manually

1. **Session Transition:**
   - Manually copied handoff prompt to new session
   - Re-established context about task status

2. **Documentation Organization:**
   - Decided on two-file system (CLAUDE_CODE_LOG.md + CLAUDE_CODE.md)
   - Claude suggested it, but I structured the approach

3. **Dependency Strategy Decision:**
   - Chose "install as needed" approach
   - Will document in WORKFLOW.md
